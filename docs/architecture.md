High-Level Architecture Design of Aegis Protocol
The Aegis Protocol architecture is deliberately designed with a layered hybrid approach to maximize the strengths of flexible off-chain computing and the security and transparency of on-chain computing.

Layer 1: Frontend (Presentation Layer)
This layer is the main interaction point for human users. It runs entirely in the client browser.

Purpose: Provide a reactive and intuitive interface for monitoring, interacting with, and managing emergency responses.

Core Technologies:

HTML5 & CSS3: For interface structure and styling.

JavaScript (ES6 Modules): For all client-side logic.

Vite: As a modern build tool and development server.

@dfinity/auth-client: Official library for integration with Internet Identity authentication system.

@dfinity/agent: Core library for creating Actors and communicating with canisters on Internet Computer.

Main Responsibilities:

User Session Management: Handle login and logout flows through Internet Identity.

Direct Canister Interaction: Create Actors to call query functions (read data) and update functions (modify data) on EventDAO and DID/SBT Ledger canisters on behalf of authenticated users.

Off-Chain Layer Communication: Send natural language commands (chat) or structured data through fetch API to endpoints provided by Validator Agent.

State Rendering: Display data from canisters (such as proposal lists) and messages from AI Agents in real-time in the UI.

Layer 2: Off-Chain Services (AI Agents & Business Logic Layer)
This layer is the "brain" and "nervous system" of the protocol. It runs in a controlled server environment (deployed using Docker) and is not directly exposed to the outside world except through specific API endpoints.

Purpose: Automate data acquisition, perform complex validation, and act as a secure bridge between the real world and blockchain.

Core Technologies:

Python 3: Main programming language for all agents.

uagents Framework: Framework for building autonomous agents that can communicate with each other.

ic-py: Library to enable Python scripts to interact (create transactions, call canisters) with the Internet Computer network.

Docker & Docker Compose: For packaging, isolating, and orchestrating the three agent services.

Main Responsibilities:

Data Acquisition (Oracle Agent): Retrieve data from various external APIs periodically.

Validation and Enrichment (Validator Agent): Apply business logic to filter and validate data. This is where AI/ML models can be integrated in the future.

API Exposure: Provide secure HTTP endpoints (e.g., /chat) for consumption by the frontend.

Automatic On-Chain Execution (Action Agent): Act as a trusted proxy with cryptographic identity (identity.pem) to call functions requiring special authorization in the blockchain layer.

Layer 3: Blockchain (On-Chain Logic & Persistence Layer)
This layer is the trust foundation of the system. It runs on the decentralized Internet Computer network.

Purpose: Provide a transparent, immutable, and always-active platform for governance, fund management, and identity recording.

Core Technologies:

Motoko: Programming language specifically designed for Internet Computer, offering strong type safety.

Internet Computer (IC): Blockchain platform that runs smart contracts (canisters) at web speed.

dfx SDK: Command-line tool for managing canister development lifecycle (create, deploy, upgrade).

Main Responsibilities:

Smart Contract Factory (Event Factory): Dynamically deploy new canisters in response to validated events.

Decentralized Governance (Event DAO): Manage proposals, voting, and fund treasury transparently for each disaster.

Liquidity Management (Insurance Vault): Store and disburse initial funds programmatically.

Identity Registry (DID/SBT Ledger): Act as a single source of truth for user profiles and their reputation credentials.

Permanent State Storage: All important data (transactions, votes, profiles) is permanently stored in canister state.
